We recently open-sourced XTTS, the best open-source text-to-speech model we‚Äôve released so far.

XTTS uses the latest generative AI techniques to deliver faster, higher-quality speech in 13 different languages. It is now accessible with üê∏TTS.

XTTS offers‚Ä¶

- Voice cloning with just a 3-second audio clip.
- Emotion and style transfer by cloning.
- Cross-language voice cloning.
- Multi-lingual speech generation.
- 24khz sampling rate.

As of now, XTTS-v1 supports the following languages: **English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Turkish, Russian, Dutch, Czech, Arabic, and Chinese.**

To start using XTTS, all you need to do is `pip install TTS`.

Here is a sample Python code and please [see the docs](https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) for more details.

```python
from TTS.api import TTS
tts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v1", gpu=True)

# generate speech by cloning a voice using default settings
tts.tts_to_file(text="It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it I'm not going to be silent.",
                file_path="output.wav",
                speaker_wav="/path/to/target/speaker.wav",
                language="en")
```
