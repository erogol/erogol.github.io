After dedicating the past six years to an open-source AI startup herein, I share my opinions about goods & bads of being open-source as a company.

This article is totally based on my personal experiences. I invite you to engage in discussion, whether you agree or disagree on any points. Please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Goods

Easier to reach your users

Cool models and projects attract a ton of attention easily. It helps you find your early users, get user feedback fast and improve your models & product. However, it is important to distinguish the signal from the noise in this feedback cycle and triage correctly to find an alignment between the user asks and the business needs.

Community is everything for open-source, greatest asset.

Actively listen to them and try address their pain points. It helps you a lot finding your product market fit. Honestly, we did a terrible job there initially and realized how important it is afterwards.

Your community is there to help for things that are impossible otherwise. Getting things done with the community is the best way to make sure that you are on the right track.

Open source is a great hiring engine.

Contributors create a great talent pool for hiring. And since they already know the code base, it is really easy to onboard them.

Github stars == VC interest

Open source repos with many stars attract investors. It is especially helpful at early stages. Later on, it is definitely not enough.

Open source introduces you to great people

You meet a ton of great people! This is probably the best part.

## Bads

Making revenue is hard.

There is yet to be found the right business model for open-source AI.

Making an API based on your model is not a viable option. There are companies who are specialied on making efficient APIs for open-source models. They deploy your model more easily, server it cheaper and faster.  So it causes a race to the bottom from day one. That's why we needed to go with non-commercial licenses at the later stages although it didn't stop many of them deploying our models without paying.

It is harder to gateway your models. It created two problems. First it is harder to make users pay even with non-commercial licenses. Many don't care about licenses, deploy your models and like your tweets. We had >1m downloads for our XTTS model and almost 30% was enterprise. However, only a fraction was self-motivated to pay. Second, people use your models in different use-cases and you have no control. You try to inform them with ToS or license but you know...

So far the only model that seems to work is consultancy like packaging, customizing models for enterprise. However, consultancy is a demanding work, slow to iterate and hard to scale.

I believe that the market needs to foster a more efficient alliance between model and distribution platforms with a fair profit-sharing arrangement. Moreover, users should understand the considerable difficulties and expenses involved in training these models and should proactively support their preferred services. Of course Meta, MS would not bother but my opinion on them being open-source is not favorable.

Making radical changes is hard.

When you need to change something, you have a community to convince and the backlash can be rough. I think it is necessary to be transparent and keep you community in the loop when you need to do that.

Haters hate

There are people who hate everything. And because you are open-source, you are more susceptible to them. Be ready and run don't care everything they say.

Managing a community is a challenging task.

An open-source company should spend enough resources for community management, advocacy. Until you have such resources, it takes a significant amount of well-deserved time.
