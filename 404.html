If you wanted to see my old blog, here is what happened ...

<font size="-5">- <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, by incompetent engineering, wiped out my 10 years old blog and its backups. Save yourself, use something else - </font>

You can still find some of my old posts on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210411132621/https://erogol.com/">web archive</a>.

If you think this is an error, please open an <a href="https://github.com/erogol/erogol.github.io/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a>.
